										<h2 class="major">Interpreting ISO/IEC 27000:2018 - managing cybersecurity risk from the inside of a large organisation</h2>
										<p>The ISO/IEC International Standard 27000 is intended to provide international standards relating to Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). This post outlines the terms and definitions from section 3 of the standards which the author believes are most relevant to the topic of managing people (in large organisations) order to prevent cybersecurity attacks from the inside. In this post I draw on some professional experience of organisational structures, hierarchies and governance mechanisms and attempt to apply this to cybersecurity practice and policy standards.</p>
                    <p><li><strong>1. Access control (3.1)</strong></p>
										<p>Access control is an essential part of the management of cyber security risk as it will ensure that access to information can only be granted on the basis of business requirements. Having robust access controls in an organisation (e.g. role-based; identity-based; rule-based) and making use of tools such as security tokens, biometric scanning and multifactor authentication are some ways to ensure that access to information is secure. Cyber risk is frequently found in the area of data protection (Accenture, n.d.) meaning that access control is especially important.</p>
                    <p><li><strong>2. Governance of information security (3.23)</strong></p>
										<p>Governance covers the system in place to direct and control an organisation’s information security activities. Resulting policies and procedures should come from the very top-level of an organisation’s management (e.g. through employing a Chief Information Security Officer, CISO) to ensure that information security is a strategic business priority, and allowing governance principles to trickle down throughout the organisation. Taking a holistic approach to security governance also means that the company can be more agile in the face of risks (Accenture, n.d.) and this must come from top leadership.</p>
                    <p><li><strong>3. Information security continuity (3.29)</strong></p>
										<p>Information security continuity refers to the procedures in place for ensuring continued information security operations and should ideally be on the agenda of a CISO. Achieving this will require effective ongoing resource allocation, training of individuals, proper updating, inventory and maintenance of operating systems, software, hardware, cloud technologies and access controls, for example (NIST, 2023). Accenture (n.d.) identify the key areas which typically introduce vulnerabilities as being critical infrastructure, applications, networks, cloud, internet of things and it is important that protective measures (e.g. firewalls and antivirus, encryption, password policy, monitored internet access) are maintained properly in these areas.</p>
                    <p><li><strong>4. Risk communication and consultation (3.65)</strong></p>
                    <p>The communication of information security risk is a continual and iterative process that results in continued information-sharing and dialogue with organisational stakeholders around the management of risk. It should encompass security training measures and risk reporting procedures, which are essential mechanisms for internal information security. Good communication and consultation will help an organisation to more quickly understand the seriousness of and how to react to a cybersecurity event (NIST, 2023).</p>
                    <p><li><strong>5.  Risk management process (3.70)</strong></p>
                 		<p>Finally, it is absolutely essential to have a systematic risk management policy in place which outlines the process of risk management, including the identification, assessment and documentation of security risks (NIST, 2023).</p>
