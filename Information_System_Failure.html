										<h2 class="major">Information System Failure - Nest Thermostat</h2>
										<p><strong>This discussion topic required us to research an information system failure and it's impact.</p> 
										<p>Here is my initail discussion post on the topic and a summary of peer feedback:</strong></p>
										<p></p>
                    								<p><strong>Initial Post:</strong></p>
                    								<p>The Nest thermostat system is an example of an embedded software system "where the software controls some hardware device and is embedded in that device" (Sommerville 2016). The device is connected to the internet, allowing users to remotely adjust the temperature in their properties and also facilitating the device to 'learn' the ideal temperatures for a home, based on the daily routines of the owners, thereby reducing energy bills (Wakefield, 2016). In January 2016 Nest experienced an issue, reportedly following a software update, which caused the devices to fail in different ways, for example to initiate the wrong daily routine, to run out of battery or to simply go offline/ fail altogether. Nest reacted quickly offering a fix for 99.5% of customers, demonstrating that the service provider cannot always guarantee a quick solution for all customers during such failures.</p>
										<p>The topic raises a wider issue of the reliability of such IoT technologies. In this case, as Misener (2016) pointed out, smart-technology / IoT solutions in their early implementation phase may not be immediately fixable should the device fail or experience a bad update in the early phase of development. It also raises the question of how reliable and secure such devices can be, and puts into focus IT security issues, such as remote hacking (Wakefield, 2016). Nest had already experienced some issues with a smoke alarm which could be unexpectedly deactivated with the wave of a hand, causing the product immediately to be made unavailable and existing users to be offered refunds until the software had been updated (Anon, Reuters, 2014). As suggested by Power & Kotonya (2019) "fault-tolerance support" should ideally be built in to Internet of Things (IoT) systems, especially as systems tend to be inflexible and susceptible to unexpected bugs.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Discussion: Summary of peer responses</h2>
										<p></p>
                    								<p>One of my fellow students pointed out that it can be a shock when seemingly strong information systems unexpectedly fail, but that the underlying reasons may lie in the fact that the development of technology is largely dependent on having the skilled labour to implement such technologies and that the inventor of the technology can understand the user of the technology. In this sense it is a problem of both quick innovation and economics/ economic development and the fact that technology specialists may not always be able to bridge the gap between understanding what the user needs and can operate and what the technology can do.</p>
										<p>A second fellow student mentioned that not all software bugs can be eliminated completely before being published to users and that the more users use and feedback on the system, the better it will become. This approach relies on the fact that the development team responsible for the technology implementation see user feedback as being part of the development process. In terms of risk assessment, developers should always consider the likelihood of a certain negative outcome occurring.</p>
										<p></p>
                    								<h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
                    								<p></p>
                    								<p>We can conclude from this discussion that in the development of technology, mostly due to human factory, bugs and failures are inevitable. However, the negative impact of bugs can be reduced by listening to user feedback and directly implementing software improvements which target the specific complaints of the user. This apporach clearly supports an iterative approach to software development.</p>
