										<h2 class="major">Computing as a Profession</h2>
										<p>In this unit, we began discussing computer science as a profession and the challenges this poses, such as handling data responsibly (in line with GDPR guidelines), securely and effectively. One of the key topics here is ensuring organisational information security, normally by an IT policy. My research led me to understand that the main challenges here are managing stakeholder perceptions and expectations of any implemented policies and understanding the complexities and interdependenceies of organisational information.</p>
										<p>I recommend the following two articles on this topic:</p>
										<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401218303451">Samonas, S., Dhillon, G., & Almusharraf, A. (2020). Stakeholder perceptions of information security policy: Analyzing personal constructs. International Journal of Information Management, 50.</a></li>

										<h2 class="major">Emerging Trends in Computer Science</h2>
										<p>I used the ‘Learn with Google AI’ repository to explore a crash course in Machine Learning. I am interested in developing a sound understanding of this field and hope that it will also change the way I approach problems in future.</p>
										<p>Key points include:</p>
										<p>"ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data."</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>A Machine Learning model is trained by starting with an initial guess for the weights and bias and iteratively adjusting those guesses until learning the weights and bias with the lowest possible loss.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>A <strong>regression model</strong> predicts continuous values. For example, regression models make predictions that answer questions like the following:</p>
										<p>• What is the probability that a user will click on this ad?</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>A <strong>classification model</strong> predicts discrete values. For example, classification models make predictions that answer questions like the following:</p>
										<p>• Is a given email message spam or not spam?</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>I also began to explore the concept of bias in Machine Learning models, and how this might be built in to a model, depending on the context and parameters of the problem. Also, there are different ways to measure the accuracy of a model and it is possible to engineer the accuracy of a model, depending on the objective or on the resources available.<p>
										<p>Algorithms are increasingly being used to decide 'fair' outcomes. Is this ethical?</p>
										<p>I found the following recommended article very interesting</p>
										<li><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/17/75285/ai-fairer-than-judge-criminal-risk-assessment-algorithm/">Can you make AI fairer than a judge?</a></li></span></p>

										<h2 class="major">Computing Infrastructure & Networks</h2>
										<p>In this unit we focused on the networking capabilities of computer networks and the technology, topology, protocols and hardware involved.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p><em>Some important definitions and concepts include:</em></p>
										<p><strong>Network classifications</strong> such as <strong>PAN</strong> (Personal Area Network, for very short distance communications), <strong>LAN</strong> (Local Area Network, normally for several computers within one institution or office).</p>
										<p></p>
										<p><strong>Topology</strong> is the organization of the network – i.e. via a <strong>bus</strong> or <strong>wireless star</strong> network. The <strong>client/server</strong> model is an example of interprocess communication where the process machine (the client) makes a request of another process (the server) to complete the task at hand. The <strong>peer-to-peer (P2P)</strong>> model involves processes that require services from each other (not only from the server).</p>
										<p><strong>Protocols</strong> are like a set of ‘rules’ which govern how communication activities are conducted. <strong>CSMA/CD</strong> (Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is a protocol used on a network of devices connected across a bus network where the machines will monitor all messages transmitted, keep the ones for itself and if required to transmit a message and a clash occurs, will try again later. This is not the case for machines connected via wireless networks (the standard being <strong>WiFi</strong>) which operate a <strong>CSMA/CA</strong> (Collision Avoidance) principle as the wireless nature of the communication means they cannot detect a collision.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p><strong>Hardware</strong> includes devices that facilitate the computer network. For example an <strong>Access Point</strong> is a device that creates a wireless local area network (WLAN), a <strong>repeater</strong> is a device which passes messages between buses, a <strong>bridge</strong>>passes messages between buses for a specific destination address and a <strong>switch</strong> connects several buses and also only sends messages to the specific destination. <strong>Routers</strong> are special computer devices which manage the connection between networks by forwarding messages to form an internet.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>In distributed computer systems, <strong>Cluster Computing</strong> is a distributed system where many computers work together to provide a service which would otherwise require a much larger machine, which is less costly than a supercomputer and leads to better availability of the service. <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> is a new trend in this area where a large pool of shared computers can be used by clients as and when they need it. Cloud services allow users to rent virtual computers without needing to know where the physical hardware is located. This allows for more flexibility in collaboration.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p><strong>The Internet</strong> is a collection of connected networks that today links millions of computers connected by PANs, LANs, MANs, WANs etc. <strong>An internet/ intranet</strong> is a network provided by a single authority to individuals. Each computer within an internet has an <strong>IP Address</strong> that basically identifies each computer within the system.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p><em>A note on cyber security:</em></p>
										<p>The networking capabilities of computers can be very beneficial for improving quality of life and work, but are also vulnerable to cyber attacks. <strong>Viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware</strong> and <strong>phishing</strong> are all methods of compromising a computer network. Wireless communication enables transfer protocols to facilitate the remote control of a device, which is seen applied in Internet of Things (IoT) technology applications (e.g. cars, smarthomes and MedTech). However, without a full understanding of security risks involved in IoT technology, this could be cause great vulnerability to malicious attacks, especially as the application of wireless networking technology becomes more widespread across mutlitple networks. Cars are a good example of this but also healthcare is a risky application area. The ‘internet of medical things’ increases the interconnectivity of devices related to healthcare monitoring and patient data processing, but the increased interconnectivity of these devices and the broad range of devices/ networks on which data is stored create new paths for cyber attacks.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Software as a Tool</h2>
										<p>In this unit we considered software, in terms of system software (e.g. operating systems) and application software. We were also introduced to the concept of ‘programming languages’ – Python, C++ etc. – and their different purposes as
										Assembler, Compiler or Interpreter.
										<p></p>
										<p>An operating system (OS) is the software controlling how a computer functions and operates, including storing and accessing files, executing programs and providing the necessary software to run certain applications.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>Windows is probably the best-known operating system around. It was developed in the 80s and is widely used on PCs but is not active in the mobile OS sector, where Android and iOS are the most commonly used. Windows is so popular because it can run a huge range of software and most programs are compatible with it. It is also necessary to buy a user license to use Windows. Windows also has gained a reputation for crashing or having service outage.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>Linux is a less commonly used OS and it is free of charge and open source, meaning that anyone can run or change the code to function differently for their use purpose. It is also supposed to be more stable and secure (i.e. less vulnerable to malicious attacks) than Windows. The user interface however is not as simple as windows is and some applications must be installed via the command line, which not everyone is familiar with.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>We also looked briefly at the process of developing software, which is often conducted according to SCRUM methodology. SCRUM is intended to be a very lean approach to the development of new software and applications, because it takes an iterative approach – i.e. development is structured in sprints, which work on one small piece of a larger project and aim to get that right before moving on to the next. In this way, improvements are always being made to the software and the work done is reviewed and improved by all members of the team, who each have a special role in the process.</p>

										<h2 class="major">System Software</h2>
										<p>When investigating the features of the Windows operating system, I noted the following:<p\>
										<p></p>
										<p>The preferences section on this OS allows the user to customize their experience using the machine. It is possible to set rules for app notifications and display features (such as connecting to an external monitor and optimizing the view), optimizing the battery life and identifying which apps use most battery power, how much harddisk space is free on the machine and which apps are taking up the most space. It also shows the user the details about the device e.g:</p>
										<p>Device name: MUV-27XBW33</p>
										<p>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8365U CPU @ 1.60GHz 1.90 GHz</p>
										<p>Installed RAM: 8,00 GB (7,78 GB usable)</p>
										<p>Device ID: xxx (example)</p>
										<p>Product ID: 00330-513xxx</p>
										<p>System type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor</p>
										<p>Pen and touch No pen or touch input is available for this display</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>Clicking on ‘Device Manager’ allows the user to identify the hardware that is installed on the computer and also any network and software components. For example, my work machine contains ‘network adapters’ including an VPN Virtual Ethernet Adapter, which allows me to connect and to send and receive traffic to my work network without a physical adapter. There are also several protection settings, which may prevent the computer being visible within the network, for example.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>If you make a new folder and look at the properties of this folder, the first thing I noticed was that the folder size and the size on disk is not the same. After some research, I realise that the size on disk represents the total number of bytes occupied on the hard drive – i.e. the number of bits reserved for the folder size, not the maximum size of a folder. This is the same with a file. From the properties, the user can also see the file or folder path, and control who has access to the data created (i.e. other users or clients in the user network).</p>

										<h2 class="major">Introduction to Algorithms & Coding</h2>
										<p>Notes on algorithms:</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>An algorithm must have a <strong>well-established structure</strong>.</p>
										<p>The steps of an algorithm are <strong>sequenced</strong> – i.e. they are executed in the order they are given.</p>
										<p>An<strong> algorithm is abstract</strong> – one algorithm can be represented in many ways.</p>
										<p>A <strong>program</strong> is a representation of an algorithm.</p>
										<p>A <strong>process</strong> is the activity of executing a program.</p>
										<p>A <strong>primitive</strong> is a building block from which an algorithm can be constructed.</p>
										<p>Each primitive has its <strong>own syntax and semantics</strong>.</p>
										<p>A collection of primitives makes up a <strong>programming language</strong>.</p>
										<p><strong>Pseudocode</strong> is a notational system used to express ideas formally during algorithm development.</p>
										<p><strong>Iteration</strong> is the repetition of part of an algorithm until a condition is met or for a specified number of times.</p>
										<p><strong>Indentation</strong> enhances the readability of a program.</p>
										<p><strong>Recursive structures</strong> can be used to repeat a set of structures as a subtask itself.</p>
										<p>The development of a program consists of <strong>discovering the underlying algorithm</strong> and <strong>representing the algorithm as a program</strong> - it requires a method of problem-solving.</p>
										<p><strong>Algorithms solve problems</strong> - first you must understand the problem before you can formulate the algorithm.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p><em>Tips for algorithm development:</em></p>
										<p><strong>Stepwise refinement</strong> - don't try to solve the whole task at once</p>
										<p><strong>Use loops</strong> - this makes things more flexible instead of repeating code over and over</p>
										<p><strong>Successful loop control</strong> - means initialize, test, modify</p>
										<p><strong>Use lists</strong> - to organise information within an album (not variables)</p>
										<p><strong>Follow principles of SCRUM</strong> - as an iterative approach to algorithm development</p>
										<p><strong>Ask the right questions</strong> to identify the right data and process</p>
