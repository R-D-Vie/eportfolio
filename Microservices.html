										<h2 class="major">Discussion: Microservices and Microkernels</h2>
                    <p><strong>“Torvalds has been proven wrong and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices and microkernels are the future."</strong></p>
										<p>In this post I begin with an admission: I did not read the entire debate between Torvalds, Tanenbaum et al, as I found it very difficult to follow, especially when more participants joined as well. I got about half-way through before skimming to the end, but I think the debate was largely focussed on the same topics.</p>
										<p>To demonstrate my understanding, I would summarise the main conclusion as being that Linux’s monolithic kernel was criticised by Tanenbaum for its lack of reliability and out-datedness in terms of the development of computing whereas Torvald accepted that the microkernel approach was superior but claimed that Tanenbaum’s implementation in MINIX was subpar because it slowed down performance significantly and could not guarantee effective multi-tasking without using workarounds. I think I find both arguments compelling in that it is all well and good to claim that a system is superior, but if the alternative cannot be implemented well, it is also not a solution.</p>
                    <p>If we look at the current computing landscape now, 30 years on, it is impossible to compare with the environment that Torvald and Tanenbaum were working in. As Liu et al., (2021) point out:</p>
                    <p><i>“…the development of device drivers, protocol stacks, file systems and other low-level systems… caused monolithic kernels to change all the time and brought a serious burden to maintenance.”</i></p>
                    <p>Also as Fritzsch et al. (2018) point out, with the development of cloud computing, business needs in terms of availability or services and technology, scaling, security and infrastructure management has caused a huge race to break legacy systems down and repurpose them as microservices which can be better managed in terms of user privileges and business continuity. Breaking down monolithic legacy systems into multiple services promotes flexibility and helps to manage isolated failures, but is a very complex process to which there is no one-size-fits-all approach (Fritzsch et al., 2018).</p>
                    <p>Microkernel technology developed as a solution to support services in separate kernels for more flexible and reliable operation (Liu et al., 2021). This reflects an increasing shift toward distributed systems and modular architectures. A purely monolithic architecture also presents a key security risk in that it does not comply with the principle of least privilege (Liu et al., 2021; Ramos, 2022). However, I believe I have understood correctly when I say that the microservice approach can alleviate some of these issues, without necessarily requiring a microkernel infrastructure, which may also cause performance and implementation issues.</p>
                    <p>To conclude, it seems to me that refactoring monolithic applications into microservices deployed via a distributed architecture might be a good way to solve some of the reliability and security issues which are inherent to monolithic architectures, as discussed by Fritzsch et al. (2018). In mainstream computing, operating system kernel architecture seems to be hybrid, with the microkernel only being utilised for some modules (Liu et al., 2021). This may be because issues of storage and performance are yet to be resolved in a purely microkernel operating system. I would therefore tentatively conclude that a microservice approach is a definite advantage in terms of improving security and flexibility, especially for business purposes, but purely microkernel OS architecture has a way to go before it can promise better performance than a hybrid approach. So, in response to the statement above, yes, they may be the future, but we are still not past the monolithic architecture stage yet.</p>
