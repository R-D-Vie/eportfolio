										<h2 class="major">What is a Secure Programming Language? Team Discussion</h2>
										<p>Based on input and discussions with other group members and the provided literature (see references below), I produced the following answers to the set questions for this task.  
                    <p><strong>1.	What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</strong></p>
										<p>The main reason that vulnerable code is written without a developer being aware is because programming languages do not implement abstractions which facilitate the writing of secure code (Cifuentes & Bierman (2019). A language that protects against three key vulnerabilities - buffer errors, injection attacks and information leaks – is a secure language (Cifuentes & Bierman (2019). However, no single programming language handles any of these vulnerabilities perfectly. Cifuentes & Bierman (2019) and Pillai (2017) explain that buffer errors can be protected against using managed memory (which can be convenient for developers, but can also cause runtime overhead), input preparation and sanitization, ‘taint tracking’ and not accepting input strings from 3rd party APIs or libraries can address injection errors, but these are not necessarily in-built functionality of the programming language. Cifuentes & Bierman (2019) add that it is not possible to protect against information leak vulnerabilities in any language and that abstractions in a language must be easily understandable and have a predictable performance overhead if they are to be used in practice by programmers.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.	Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</strong></p>
										<p>It could well be argued that no programming language can be classified as secure as it will depend on the skill of the developer to build security into the way a program is written through the proper use of features, libraries and a secure approach to designing objects, methods and classes which prevent malicious program manipulation. Pillai (2017) recommends several strategies for security when writing code in Python, such as using libraries to read passwords and cryptographic hashing for passwords rather than comparing original memory, not storing sensitive data to local functions, not using the Python pickle module to serialize objects, and several more. Python itself does not protect against any of the three vulnerabilities mentioned in question one without the concurrent use of libraries or having the coding skill to protect against injection attacks or information leaks. Python also includes powerful functions (e.g. exec and eval) which may lead to dangerous code vulnerabilities (Pillai, 2017). I would therefore conclude that Python itself is not a secure language per se, but that this is also not its role: it provides a framework to be handled securely, but this ultimately relies on the awareness and meticulousness of the developer.</p>
                    <p><strong>3.	Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</strong></p>
										<p>Python is a dynamic language, whereas C is a compiled language which means that it can be executed directly on the hardware. This is a big advantage for operating systems. Python uses managed memory, which is often not used in operating system development due to its unpredictable performance overhead (Cifuentes & Bierman, 2019). Python in general is more abstracted than C which is not ideal for operating system development as the cognitive load is high Cifuentes & Bierman (2019).
