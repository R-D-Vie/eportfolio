										<h2 class="major">Unit 1: OWASP Top 10 (2021) and UML Modelling for Security</h2>
										<p>This unit focussed on introducing the topic of secure software development by exploring the<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/"> OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks </a>. Our primary formative task was to produce a short academic post about a particular vulnerability from this list and a flowchart and UML diagram which would explain how this vulnerability might be exploited by a hacker.<a href="#id1"> Read the post here</a>.</p>
										<p>At the end of Unit 1, I am feeling overwhelmed with the amount of documentation and best practice principles there are to navigate in order to learn how to design secure software. However, I feel that this is a very realistic way to start, as secure software design is a vast topic that can really slow down the development process, contrary to society's general preferences of quick and resource-efficient design. It seems essential that we must learn to be more meticulous in our approach to designing software.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Unit 2: Agile Software Development and Security Standards</h2>
										<p>In Seminar 1, we discussed the agile framework and how suitable this is or how it can be adapted to include secure software design and development principles. This is not an easy task, as the iterative agile development process means that security can become a forgotten, secondary or non-continuous task (especially due to its inherent resource-intensiveness and the fact that the full project requirements are not always known in advance, or may change throughout the project). However, in an article by Sharma, A. & Bawa, R. K. (2022) we learned that the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl">Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle Process</a> and the <a href="TheCLASPApplicationSecurityProcess.pdf">OWASP CLASP Framework</a> can be applied well to the various phases of agile software development, mainly because they do not require a sequential process like other security models.</p>
										<p>For our formative task, we took a critical look at the ISO/IEC 27000:2018 Security Standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) and produced a blog post with our thoughts on how cybersecurity threats can be prevented from within an organisation (i.e. through managing people and processes). <a href="#id2">My blog post can be read here</a>.</p>
										<p>At this stage, I am now feeling more familiar with vulnerabilities from a theoretical standpoint, but am looking forward now to seeing how this can work in practice and in learning some secure coding techniques in the next unit.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Unit 3: Programming Languages: History, Concepts & Design</h2>
										<p>One particularly interesting aspect of this unit was learning more about the Church-Turing Thesis. This research and theory provided the fundamental principle in comuter science by claiming that any computational problem-solving process can be simulated by a machine. If we consider the recent bounds forward in Artificial Intelligence, it is very relevant when considering the limits of what computers can and cannot do.</p>
										<p>The primary implication is that any task can be solved algorithmically by a computer program, the only limitations being time and memory.</p>
										<p>In terms of programming concepts, we began to look into Regex and Recursion. You can find code related to my attempt at the <a href="https://github.com/R-D-Vie/PythonPractice_SecureSoftwareDev/blob/99feadb2f7fd9ccaf28f71c401cc7c236e037695/Towers_of_Hanoi.py">Towers of Hanoi problem in my GitHub repository</a>.</p>
										<a href="#" class="special">Learn more</a>
										<p>We also completed our group discussion on the OWASP Top 10 - <a href="id3">see my Summary Post about what I found out about SQL Injection here</a>.</p>
										<p>At this stage in the course, I am enjoying starting to work with code again after some quite theoretical and standard-heavy input on security aspects. It has also been really interesting to consider the security of Python as a programming language, as well as other languages and to take note that it really is down to the skill of the developer in writing truly secure code. <a href="id4">You can read my thoughts on this here</a>.</p>
