										<h2 class="major">Summary Post: TrueCrypt</h2>
										<p>This has been an interesting discussion which has covered the importance of maintaining continuity for software services, especially those which provide essential security. I think most of us in this cohort of students are in agreement that we would not recommend the use of TrueCrypt for disk encryption to our friends, largely because it has too many vulnerabilities (regardless of how serious or complex these vulnerabilities might be) and is no longer maintained, meaning it cannot keep up with the developing field of encryption technology. </p>
                    <p><strong>References (for the Initial Post):</strong></p>
                    <p>Cloud computing has seen the field of encryption expand rapidly. Whereas TrueCrypt was a service to facilitate encrypted and deniable file systems (EDFS) which hid data in partitions, it was, as the vulnerabilities identified by Junestam & Guigo (2014) also show, was not perfect in preventing information leakage (Wen et al, 2014). Now we see fully integrated solutions developing, including for data which is stored in the cloud, such as Microsoft Azure’s portfolio of managed disk encryption options, which covers the whole spectrum of data encryption from encryption at host (i.e. where encryption occurs on the user’s machine before data is sent to the cloud), to server-side encryption-at-rest (i.e. encryption on the cloud server), encryption for data in transmission, disk encryption for virtual machines, operating system encryption and encryption key management (Microsoft, 2023). TrueCrypt in comparison offered a more limited service for data at rest, and required the user to manage encryption keys, which causes a significant risk of data loss should the encryption key be misplaced or forgotten. </p>
                    <p>However, the value of a service like TrueCrypt is that it is compatible with a number of operating systems and allows user choice in the use of encryption algorithms/ methods. Taking Microsoft Azure as an example, some might think that the downside is that it is dependent on a single environment and provider, which does not allow a user flexibility in terms of choice about which technologies to use. Placing all your trust in data storage and encryption with one provider may create a ‘lock-in’ risk meaning the user is dependent on one provider (Yuvaraj, 2015). Microsoft services are however highly advanced, well-maintained and provide long-term continuity. I realise that cloud service encryption is a different topic to single-user private disk encryption. However, the point I want to make is that encryption services are now often full spectrum (from hard disk to cloud) and one-size-fits all, allowing users little choice in which provider to use and, in the case of cloud storage, even where their data is stored. TrueCrypt could have been considered an authentic and agnostic service, which left the user in control of their data and also in where their data is ultimately stored.</p>

                    <p>In the discussion we touched on legacy systems and that the continued use of a service like TrueCrypt, as my colleague Michael Sammueller pointed out, is dangerous though no doubt the scenario likely exists. In our discussion we touched on the ‘don’t change what isn’t broken’ mindset or lack of resources, which prevents the updating of encryption technology and causes extremely vulnerable attack surfaces (Michael gave the example of software and systems used in hospitals, which is a particularly scary thought). We also discussed user-friendliness - the advantage that commercial single-provider solutions (like those from Microsoft) have is also surely that the encryption service is seamless and occurs with minimum user intervention. TrueCrypt in comparison, was free and open source.</p>
                    <p>What I intend to summarise in this post is how quickly the field of encryption is developing and becoming more complex and integrated, not compare two different pairs of shoes. I also want to point out that a strength of TrueCrypt is that it was platform and system agnostic, which gave the user more control. I really enjoyed this discussion and reading my colleagues’ responses.</p>
