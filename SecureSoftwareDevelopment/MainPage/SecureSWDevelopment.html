										<h2 class="major">Unit 1: OWASP Top 10 (2021) and UML Modelling for Security</h2>
										<p>This unit focussed on introducing the topic of secure software development by exploring the<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank"> OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks</a>. Our primary formative task was to produce a short academic post about a particular vulnerability from this list and a flowchart and UML diagram which would explain how this vulnerability might be exploited by a hacker. Read the post here: <a href="SecureSoftwareDevelopment/Activities/OWASPTop10.html" target="_blank">OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks (2021): A03 Injection</a>.</p>
										<p>At the end of Unit 1, I am feeling overwhelmed with the amount of documentation and best practice principles there are to navigate in order to learn how to design secure software. However, I feel that this is a very realistic way to start, as secure software design is a vast topic that can really slow down the development process, contrary to society's general preferences of quick and resource-efficient design. It seems essential that we must learn to be more meticulous in our approach to designing software.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Unit 2: Agile Software Development and Security Standards</h2>
										<p>In Seminar 1, we discussed the agile framework and how suitable this is or how it can be adapted to include secure software design and development principles. This is not an easy task, as the iterative agile development process means that security can become a forgotten, secondary or non-continuous task (especially due to its inherent resource-intensiveness and the fact that the full project requirements are not always known in advance, or may change throughout the project). However, in an article by Sharma, A. & Bawa, R. K. (2022) we learned that the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl" target="_blank">Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle Process</a> and the <a href="TheCLASPApplicationSecurityProcess.pdf" target="_blank">OWASP CLASP Framework</a> can be applied well to the various phases of agile software development, mainly because they do not require a sequential process like other security models.</p>
										<p>For our formative task, we took <b>a critical look at the ISO/IEC 27000:2018 Security Standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) and produced a blog post with our thoughts on how cybersecurity threats can be prevented from within an organisation</b> (i.e. through managing people and processes). My blog post can be read here: <a href="SecureSoftwareDevelopment/Activities/ISOIEC.html" target="_blank">Blog Post: ISO/IEC 27000:2018</a>.</p>
										<p>At this stage, I am now feeling more familiar with vulnerabilities from a theoretical standpoint, but am looking forward now to seeing how this can work in practice and in learning some secure coding techniques in the next unit.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Unit 3: Programming Languages: History, Concepts & Design</h2>
										<p>One particularly interesting aspect of this unit was learning more about the Church-Turing Thesis. This research provided a fundamental principle in computer science by claiming that any computational problem-solving process can be simulated by a machine. If we consider the recent bounds forward in Artificial Intelligence, we can see how relevant this concept is when considering the limits of what computers can and cannot do. The primary implication is that any task can be solved algorithmically by a computer program, the only limitations being time and memory.</p>
										<p>In terms of programming concepts, we began to look into Regex and Recursion. You can find code related to my attempt at the <a href="https://github.com/R-D-Vie/SecureSoftwareDevelopment/blob/8c16eed203af97d7a488eebbe0a6c4ffb3c3068a/Python_Practice/Towers_of_Hanoi.py" target="_blank">Towers of Hanoi problem in this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

										<p>At this stage in the course, I am enjoying starting to work with code again after some quite theoretical and standard-heavy input on security aspects. It has also been really interesting to consider the security of Python as a programming language, as well as other languages and to take note that it is often down to the skill of the developer and the continuity of techniques implemented in writing truly secure code. You can read my thoughts on this here: <a href="SecureSoftwareDevelopment/Activities/SecureProgrammingLanguages.html" target="_blank">"Group Discussion: What is a Secure Programming Language?</a>.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Unit 7: Introduction to Operating Systems</h2>
										<p>This module was quite fundamental in terms of the development of security principles in general. It appears to me that much debate around security principles stations around the fact that it has developed as an afterthought, or something that patching has been used to solve issues with programs which have been developed quickly or without proper security oversight.</p>
										<p>The assigned reading "The Protection of Information in Computer Systems" by Jerome H. Saltzer and Michael D. Schroeder was clear evidence that computer scientists have been grappling with the concepts of access, authority and allocation of privilege since as early as 1975. The key principle within operating systems is the <b>principle of least privilege</b>, or basically the protection of information. Each user of a program or operating system should be allocated only the required rights to perform necessary tasks. This leads on to role-based authentication and how to implement robust authentication mechanisms which protect sensitive information through verifiying the identity of users.</p>
										<p>Whilst concepts such as role-based access, two-factor authentication and end-to-end encryption for sensitive or personal information which is accessed via computer systems or mobile devices has become the norm these days, it is still not failsafe. It is also still the user which often lacks awareness, and password reuse or hacking is still a huge problem. Nevertheless, stringently limiting access based on roles and required privileges remains good practice in order to prevent accidental leakage of access to sensitive data, especially if we consider human factors alongside this.</p>
										<p>This module and the topics introduced therein led very nicely into the concept of cryptography. In this context and from what I have understood, security remains a topic which is very much influenced by user friendlienss - both on the side of the lay-person and the developer. It seems to me up until this point in the course that there is no common acceptance of what secure software-deisgn really is and that programming techniques have developed so quickly that original concerns about access and protection have not been properly implemented.</p>
										<p>We also tried some coding exercises in this module, including a <a href="https://github.com/R-D-Vie/SecureSoftwareDevelopment/blob/f52fa87fbe9027bccfa32e37a5e29eeb209c80a5/Python_Practice/Simple_Shell.py" target="_blank">simple python shell</a>.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Unit 8: Cryptography and Its Use in Operating Systems</h2>
										<p>In this module we looked more closely at cryptography and considered the case of Truecrypt. The question posed for the group discussion on this topic was interesting - would you recommend the use of a disk-encryption service which is no longer maintained and has known vulnerabilities, including data loss, to your friends?</p>
										<p>The question seemed strange at first, but it became apparent that it was actually very multi-faceted. Our group discussion covered the continuity of software services, the ethical problem of 'backdoors' in encryption services, user-friendliness of security solutions, security of legacy systems, commercial and cloud storage and integrated encryption solutions and the fundamental difficulty of securing systems against data loss (as shown by the fact that OWASP continues to list this in the top 10 security vulnerabilities of software applications.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Unit 10: From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures // Faceted Data</h2>
										<p>I found this week's reading activities about faceted data and dynamic allocation of privileges really fascinating. This was also a perfect development of some of the topics from unit seven, including the principle of least privilege, which has been the very foundation of developing approaches to security in computing.</p>
										<p>It seems to me that secure software development as a concept is centered around protecting information and data, rather than diverse techniques to push back malicious users. A program which has been built with dynamic security design or faceted information flow, does not need to be patched to keep the hackers out, because it would ideally patch itself by repeatedly evaluating the roles, permissions and visibility of the information it processes.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Unit 11: Future Trends in Secure Software Development</h2>
										<p>In this unit we took a look into the future, and considered new trends and their security concerns, for example the security issues behind the Internet of Things (IoT). I think it is quite worrying that the boom in internet technologies has caused a huge growth in attack surface and vulnerabilities. IoT devices are a part of our daily lives, yet they implement weak authentication, firmware vulnerabilities, inadequate updates and software patching and lack of user awareness on how to properly protect oneself against software vulnerabilities. This links to an argument I touched on in a previous unit about the user-friendliness of TrueCrypt and other encryption technologies playing a large part in the proper end-use and development.</p>
										<p>My research for the upcoming seminar on microkernels also led me to read up a little more on Google's open source operating system Fuchsia. This is an entirely modular system upon which libraries and applications can be added or removed and security patch updates can be made in a much more secure way, and most importantly without leaking user data or data from other applications. Having seen the extent of vulnerabilities present in modern software applications, architecture and operating systems, this abstracted approach and non-arbitrary execution of principles of least privilege brings great potential for the future of secure software. <i>My reference for this comment is: Ramos, A. (2022) A Short introduction to Fuchsia - Fuchsia OS.
