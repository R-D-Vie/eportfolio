# The Producer-Consumer mechanism

```Python
# code source: https://techmonger.github.io/55/producer-consumer-python/

from threading import Thread
from queue import Queue

q = Queue()
final_results = []

def producer():
    for i in range(100):
        q.put(i)
        

def consumer():
    while True:
        number = q.get()
        result = (number, number**2)
        final_results.append(result)
        q.task_done()
   
   
for i in range(5):
    t = Thread(target=consumer)
    t.daemon = True
    t.start()
    
producer()

q.join()

print (final_results)
```

1. How is the queue data structure used to achieve the purpose of the code?

The queue data structure is used to implement the communication and coordination between the producer and consumer threads. The queue acts as a buffer or a shared resource where the producer puts items, and the consumer retrieves items from. 

The queue acts as a buffer or a shared data structure between the producer and consumer threads. The producer adds items to the queue using the put method, while the consumer retrieves items from the queue using the get method. The queue provides thread-safe access to the shared data, ensuring that multiple threads can interact with it without conflicts.

2. What is the purpose of ```q.put(i)?```

It puts each number in range 0-100 into the queue using the 'put' method.

3. What is achieved by ```q.get()?```

It retrieves an item from the queue using the 'get' method.

4. What functionality is provided by ```q.join()?```

The join method is called on the queue object. This line blocks the program until all tasks in the queue are completed. It ensures that the main program waits for all the consumer threads to finish processing all the items in the queue before moving on to the next line of code. This synchronization allows for orderly completion of all tasks.

5. Extend this producer-consumer code to make the producer-consumer scenario available in a secure way. What technique(s) would be appropriate to apply?
- Encrypt the data before it is put in the queue by the producer and decrypt it when retrieved by the consumer
- Use authorisation so that only authorised users can access the system
- Use secure protocols to protect the communication between producer and consumer
