										<h2 class="major">Collaborative Discussion 2: Cryptography case study: TrueCrypt</h2>
										<h2> class="major">Initial Post</h2>
										<p>The case study by Junestam & Guigo (2014) confirms that, due to TrueCrypt’s eleven key vulnerabilities, continuing to use TrueCrypt would be unwise, especially as the identified security issues have not been fixed. However, the wording of this question does make it worth considering if there may be any scenarios where it could be acceptable to continue using an out of date and vulnerable encryption service such as TrueCrypt, even if it seems unlikely. The only caveat which can be considered from my perspective is if the encrypted data is very low-sensitivity /with a legacy system background where upgrading the encryption software or the data storage method would be unnecessarily cumbersome, expensive or use valuable resources/ manpower, it may be acceptable to decide to leave it be. However, this scenario seems very unlikely, as the data would really have to be of very low value or outdated, which begs the question as to why it has not been cleaned up or disposed of in the first place.</p>
                   	<p>In TrueCrypt’s case it also seems that the software itself was not very user friendly at all which is another reason I would not recommend its use to any friends or colleagues, and the same still goes for VeraCrypt as the forked version of the solution (Gujurati & Vasserman, 2013; Spero et al., 2018). For encryption software which is designed to be fully secure by design which does not allow data decryption without the correct password or key (and will never implement any backdoor to access data in case of a lost password) (VeraCrypt, 2017), it is essential that the user understands properly how to use it. I would only recommend such a solution to someone who is technically able of understanding the full functionality.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to note that the vulnerabilities outlined by Junestam & Guigo (2014) are of varying complexity and severity and the classes of vulnerabilities are limited to five areas: Cryptography, Data Exposure, Data Validation, Denial of Service and Error Reporting. These vulnerabilities can be found also in the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities list: A02 Sensitive Data Exposure/Cryptographic Failures, Software and Data integrity Failures, Vulnerable and Outdated Components (i.e. those which may lead to DoS attacks) and Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (OWASP, 2021). This suggests that these areas are still categorically vulnerable and that, although there are surely more secure and favourable solutions than TrueCrypt, 9 years after TrueCrypt’s discontinuation, there are still similar issues occurring within software security. This is simply something to note as we learn about the complexities of designing secure software.</p>
                    <p>If a user were to encrypt a disk storing bank details or other sensitive information using TrueCrypt, the most severe weakness would surely be that of data exposure through the ineffective clearing of data with memsnet(). My understanding is that many of the other vulnerabilities are either highly complex to exploit (difficulty rating) or of lower risk.</p>

                    								<p><i></i>My colleagues were disccusing the fact that TrueCrypt's weaknesses may lead to other issues, including backdoors. They also mentioned anonymity of the authors and the issues of trust that brought up. I found this really interesting in terms of user-friendliness and introduced the following response:</i></p>
                    <p>First of all, I believe that TrueCrypt and subsequently VeraCrypt strongly maintain that there are no backdoors to their software, not even potential ones which could be caused by them named vulnerabilities, and that this is one of their key principles. I only mention this as it is a hotly debated topic in cybersecurity regulation and the protection of personal data vs. law enforcement. Though Junestam & Guigo (2014) found some vulnerabilities that may lead to the leakage of sensitive information, I do not believe they found any evidence of backdoors – in fact they mention this at the beginning.</p>
                    <p>I also do not mention this to point out that you are wrong (I had to double check myself), but actually because I find the topic of backdoors quite baffling. Several countries (e.g. the ‘five-eyes’ surveillance alliance) are pushing to force tech and telecommunications companies to implement backdoors into their encryption software for law enforcement purposes, especially in the context of terrorism or whistleblowing (Williams, 2020). The EU Commission is not in agreement on whether companies should be required to implement backdoors, but have turned their attention to curating talent and technology which could recover encrypted data (e.g. through ethical hacking or brute force attacks) (Koomen, 2019). While the potential to increase the attack surface of stored data through weakening encryption standards can only be counterproductive to protecting personal and sensitive data, there are some caveat situations where this may actually be quite catastrophic – for example the unexpected death of a person who has encrypted personal data related to their assets or intellectual property (Williams, 2020).</p>
                    <p>I do also want to return to my user-friendliness argument also in this discussion of TrueCrypt/ VeraCrypt in particular. By making encryption software unhackable via offering no backdoors on principle, it absolutely must also be intuitive and well-documented. It is true that users who are encrypting data should take responsibility for their own technical understanding, but human error is something that happens even at very high levels.</p>
                    <p>I hope I have not gone a little off topic in this post, but I do believe that this is an important topic which is strongly related to TrueCrypt’s sudden decision not to continue development. I am not in favour of enforced backdoors. However, perhaps as Michael says, it is a good idea to patch the security flaws to alleviate concerns of users who trusted the software and whose data may be fatally compromised by it.</p>

										<p><i>My colleague mention that TrueCrypt may have offered sufficient protection 10 years ago as technology was not so advanced. I found the topic of lack of knowledge interesting and provided this response:</i></p>
										<p>Thank you for your ideas. I think it is very interesting that you consider that TrueCrypt would have once offered a sufficient level of protection due to the fact that the technology was not as advanced and that also perhaps attackers were not as knowledgeable. After TrueCrypt was declared unsafe and stopped operations, I have found some evidence that users were reassured that it was safer than the audits suggested. For example, Goodin (2015) makes the point that TrueCrypt was safe for encrypting data at rest and was only inherently insecure for when the volume is mounted in a running system and a key is kept in memory. I have also read that there are some scenarios where BitLocker does not offer adequate protection, or where it is vulnerable to attack and about the multiple ways that cryptographic software can fail due to bugs in code or weak random number generators for encryption keys (Yoosuf, 2017). It seems the problems are universal and that often ‘safe’ tools turn out to have serious vulnerabilities.</p>
										<p>But what I am basically trying to say is that you have touched on a really important point, and that is that lack of knowledge may be the key to repeated failings, attacks and vulnerabilities in cryptography. Would you have any additional comments on this view? It seems too simplistic to say it is just a lack of knowledge, so I am not sure if we can continue to discuss a little more about the root causes of what leads to this lack of knowledge or the speed at which the technology is evolving.</p>
