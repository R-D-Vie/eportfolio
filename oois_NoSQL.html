										<h2 class="major">Alternatives to SQL - NoSQL</h2>
										<p><strong>This discussion topic required us to research alterantives to relational (usually SQL) databases, where I looked at graph databases specifically.</p> 
										<p>Here is my initial discussion post on the topic and a summary of peer feedback:</strong></p>
										<p></p>
                    <p><strong>Initial Post:</strong></p>
                    <p>Relational databases such as MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server etc have been developed to store relational data as efficiently as possible but maintaining data consistency is a difficult process as data is often schematic (Anon, Simply Explained, 2021). NoSQL databases are good for data that is unstructured as the data can be stored within them in many ways, e.g. column-oriented, document-oriented, graph-based or using key value systems, which means that you can create and implement documents with their own unique structure to the database (Smallcombe, 2021). Graph technology is a NoSQL technique which is growing in popularity to model complex datasets (Poirier, 2022) as it is an excellent data visualisation tool.</p>
										<p>According to Webber and Van Bruggen (2020) “A graph database uses highly inter-linked data structures built from nodes, relationships, and properties. In turn, these graph structures support sophisticated, semantically rich queries at scale.” This indicates that a graph-based database is focused on demonstrating important relationships between data to the user, rather than simply being used to store data to be queried by the user. Williams (2021) supports that graph databases focus on the relationships between data, meaning that they are particularly useful in the world of big data as they allow effective analysis of large data sets on a visual level.</p>
										<p>In terms of how these databases function technically, Webber and Van Bruggen (2020) explain that nodes represent an entity, e.g. a person, product, diagnosis, customer etc. Each of the entities hold a unique identifier (Williams 2021). The relationships are depicted as a description/ verb (e.g. ‘sends’) demonstrating the relationship between subject and object (Webber and Van Bruggen, 2020). As there is no limit to the number and kind of relationships a node can have, graph databases have a very broad and rich data presentation and visualization potential, which means they are ideal for areas such as social networking, recommender systems, and fraud detection (Williams, 2021)</p>
                    <p>Eye on Tech (2020) indicate that graph databases in practice used for social media platforms can identify influencers, followers, user behaviors and target groups and can therefore be good use for marketing – for example Twitter uses graph database technology to analyse user-follower relationships. Another example was for Fifa22, which delivered interesting relationships between footballers, players, clubs and playing behaviour (Poirier, 2022).</p>

										<h2 class="major">Discussion: Summary Post based on peer responses</h2>
										<p></p>
                    <p>Since reading my peers’ findings on the prevalence of No SQL databases over SQL databases across the whole discussion forum, it seems that the legacy of SQL has not yet left the computing world. Many refer to the fact that SQL is inflexible, as the data model must be designed before the data can be implemented into the database, data is stored in tables and must be queried with a specific language, usually SQL, in order for an application to be able to access it (MongoDB, 2022). In addition, the scalability of relational databases is limited to expanding storage across larger computers and CPUs (MongoDB, 2022). This is obviously limiting as it requires specific knowledge of one language, cumbersome methods to load and use data and heavy use of computer architecture.</p>
										<p>Oracle (2022) points out that NoSQL databases allow data to be stored and accessed more intuitively, to be used in real-time situations and for big data as they are highly flexible and can be used on cloud computing platforms resulting in continuous availability. This is a very attractive proposition, especially in fast-paced business contexts. However Wesley (2022) interestingly notes that the main issue with SQL databases is that they are removed from the actual interface that consumes the data, although actually the data authority may be stronger in an SQL-based system (also known as RDBMS - relational database management system) as data duplication is not allowed, whereas in NoSQL data duplication is overlooked in favour of speed and ease-of-access.</p>
                                       <p>In summary, it cannot be argued that NoSQL-based databases represent a very important, elegant and intelligent way of accessing and querying complex data in real-time, and big data for non-standard use cases, however like so many current trends in tech and software have developed very quickly, meaning that there may lack some continuity in terms of integrating with business systems. More traditional business environments or functions will be more suited to relational database systems, where the non-duplication of data is fundamental (e.g. accounting) (MongoDB). In a business setting, I think it is important not to try to apply a very attractive but perhaps unsuitable technology before fully considering the existing structure of the computer system upon which an organization might be based, and to be clear on the scenario-specific limitations of both.</p>
