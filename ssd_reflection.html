										<h2 class="major">Reflection</h2>  
                    <p><i>This reflection implements Rolfe et al.’s (2001) reflective model. Word count: 990.</i></p>
                    <p><strong>WHAT?</strong></p>
										<p>I realised early on that this module was a step up from previous modules in terms of programming and object-oriented techniques. Whilst I found the academic topics extremely interesting, it was also complex, technical, and covered many aspects of computer science and information technology (for example operating systems, server architecture, microservices, microkernels) that I was not familiar with.</p>
                    <p>However, I found I could relate to the topics under discussion from a project management perspective, especially the application of Agile and the difficulties this presents in terms of delivering secure products quickly. I also tried to consider each of the topics presented from a user perspective, or from a business use case. This led me to consider aspects such as user-friendliness and even semantic complexity (e.g. in the discussion of cyclomatic complexity).</p>
                    <p>Some of the coding exercises I found difficult to apply out of context, especially as our command line design for the group project did not implement web APIs. However, through the group design project, I did see how APIs are used to facilitate communication between code modules within an offline application and I found this process interesting.</p>
                    <p><strong>SO WHAT??</strong></p>
										<p>I decided to be proactive from the beginning of the module and the team project, to demonstrate to my colleagues and project team members that I was keen to learn as much as possible and that U had some valuable key skills in assimilating concepts, designing solutions, and applying theory. I hoped this would allow me to take the lead in structuring the group project design document, contribute to module discussions from a user-focussed or business-oriented perspective and provide ‘layman’ logic in terms of how best to design the project solution. My professional experience covers the implementation of new software solutions - but from the user perspective - so I tried to make this my key skill in the group work process. I am used to being presented with new database management systems, digital collaboration platforms and learning management systems and implementing these into daily working life, training users, detecting bugs or program logic problems, and communicating these with developers and product specialists. It was the first time that I was getting to look at this from the development perspective and working with people who were used to delivering a software product which fit the specifications of the client.</p>
                    <p>That being said, my aim for participating in this post-graduate course was to learn programming, software development and software project management skills. Realising that I was the least experienced in coding early in the group work, from week six onwards I felt uncomfortable in terms of my ability to contribute to the group project. I therefore committed myself to actively asking my group colleagues for their help, even if it were for basic tasks (I had some issues working with Github from the command line, for example). And I was very fortunate to have been met with genuine willingness to help, explain, and supervise from my colleagues’ part, which I was grateful for. To demonstrate my commitment to the success of the project, I was careful to make a solid attempt at completing the coding tasks I volunteered myself for, ask for help when needed and in good time, and to support in areas where I felt I could bring value, such as writing a detailed README or making suggestions for improved code commenting. I also took every opportunity to take part in code demonstrations and discussions on implementation, even if these happened in addition to our twice-weekly group calls.</p>
                    <p>I also realised that engaging actively in all course formative activities, reading and coding exercises in a consistent and stepwise way throughout the course would be the best way to get as much as possible from a learning perspective. I read a lot, even when the material was challenging and difficult to understand. A lot of the reading presented fundamental concepts of software design and security, but these were also quite old (and obviously, fundamental). I therefore tried to read more widely to find examples of scenarios which implemented these views in modern scenarios – I looked at both popular computing and innovation journalism (e.g. medium.com) and more recent academic work (IEEE Xplore was particularly useful) to understand how these theories are understood and applied today.</p>
                    <p>Further, I realised that security in software development is limited by user-friendliness, lack of universal standard practice and lack of development time, and this helped me to develop a view on how to apply what I have learned in practice.</p>
                    <p><strong>NOW WHAT???</strong></p>
										<p>It is clear that I will never become a strong developer. This was never my goal, although I did hope to feel more comfortable with programming by the end of this module. However, I also have a strong interest in software project management, and I found this course incredibly useful to gain insight into how often security is implemented as an afterthought or considered an inconvenience. I also realise that secure software development comes as much from educating developers and users as from using secure development techniques. I have learned that some of the most fundamental security issues (for example, implementing the rule of least privilege or exposing sensitive information through insecure design) are still not uniformly protected against and that even the most well-known software providers engage in retrospective patching and risky design sprints. </p>
                    <p>From a practical perspective, I have learned a lot about how modular and object-oriented programming works in practice. I also found the tools for testing code consistency and conformability (i.e., linters and coverage tools) useful to keep coding styles and conventions in check. I intend to continue to learn to code and develop a more habitual approach to adhering to technical standards (such as PEP 8).</p>
										<p>Finally, I was lucky to have such a supportive team for the design project, and this made the learning experience extremely fulfilling.</p>
